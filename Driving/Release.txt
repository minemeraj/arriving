---CarDriving CarDriving 3.2.3

Changed the requested dimensions of the background images :now the height is the double.

A first implementation of driver's position camera (press keys 1-2).

Corrected the steering,the back view (which showed the car).


---CarDriving 3.2.2 

Added the new RoadAltimetryPanel for managing altimetry in a better way.This new panel,
the RoadEditor and RoadEditorPreviewPanel are Synchronized

---CarDriving 3.2.1 and previous versions

ATTENTION:increased the heap memory need,see README for instructions (added the java VM arguments -Xms128m -Xmx256m). 

Corrected a very important orientation problem for the objects in the road editor.

A change in the road textures size,now almost doubled but with lower resolution.An attempt to create a
more interesting environment. 

The RoadEditor now remember last directory used for load and save.

Now using real 3D object and associated cubic texture that you can build with the object editor !

Removed the use in the main program and in the RoadEditor of the NUM_OBJECTS and NUM__WORLD_IMAGES parameters.
Now these programs evaluate the number of elements to load,so you can add them without modifying the code.
Renamed the road textures,now distinguished only by the cardinal number. 

Correct a serious bug on the calculation of the y direction for
the road textures.

Farther enhancements of the RoadEditor (with multiple objects selection) and of the ObjectEditor (with points translations).

In the RoadEditor now you can select with the mouse an area and so the points inside to modify.
Also made a distinction in two panels between function to manage object and those to manage road components.

Fixed a bug of the steering at high speed.

Introduced the polygon mesh to manage the car building.

Performed a new change in the cardefault3D files,now using the topologic (o mesh) format,
which can be loaded and saved by the object editor,so that the latter is even more integrated to the game.

Eliminated the parameters DELTAX,DELTAY,DELTAZ,now calculated internally by the program,and the [OBJECT-INDEX],now no more necessary.

Corrected a bug in the polygons textures creation,now the movements are more credible.

A new review on the use of textures:now you can choose (in the editor) the textures for the object3D,which are treated in the same way than the ones for object2D.The transparent colors is now  the pure green for everything.Changed also the creation process of the car image ,now real time,for future improvements.

Added the rear view:press Z key !

Changed the sound production creating the AdvancedGameSound class,added a new car,again a review of the editors (added the undo).Now there are also textures for the 90° curves!

I remember that the program can be launched directly using the jar file (after extracting the lib folder!) and the java command (read the README.txt).
